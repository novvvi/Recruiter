            <p style="font-size: 14px">
                I should be grateful if you would consider my application for the <spam id="title">job title</spam>.
                I am looking forward to search for a new career opportunity in a well-established organization in
                Muscat, where my academic background and personnel skills will allow me the opportunity of growth.

            <p style="font-size: 14px">
                I enjoy twelve years of solid experience in fields of hospitality and hotel management including
                experience in the Marketing, eCommerce, Public Relations, Sales and Executive Management. I was able to
                generate success in every project completed and delivered within business.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
                During my last position, as Marketing Manager for Hilton Alexandria Green Plaza I was responsible for
                proposing and implementing marketing strategies that promote revenue growth generation among key
                targeted segments and support the hotel’s brand positioning and image. My responsibilities also included
                leveraging and executing social media and website strategies to achieve brand position and revenue
                growth goals.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
                For two years in a row I was able to achieve awards for “Best Tactical Marketing Campaign” in 2014 and
                “Best Social Media Engagement” in 2013 among Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts Middle East and Africa at the
                Hilton Worldwide Awards.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
                I am very keen to take new responsibilities with bigger operations and high challenges. I am a fast
                learner and can adapt to new situations, moving from Executive Secretary to Sales Account Manager to
                Marketing Manager in charge of Public Relations with success made in each position.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
                I am also trilingual with fluent verbal and written skills in Arabic, English and German languages and
                experienced in dealing with different cultures and nationalities.

            <p style="font-size: 14px">
                I hope I may be granted a personal interview, if you feel my qualifications fit me for the position
                needed.
